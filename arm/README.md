# arm_fin(without IK)
This is the code that was used in the IRC 2020. Here both the linear actuators are controlled independently, directly from the joystick.

# arm_ik
This is the code with inverse kinematics. This could not be tested properly due to some hardware issues. The code is also pretty rudimentry. Motion smoothening has to be implemented.

# misc. arduino codes
Contains codes for interfacing various actuators for testing.

# plot.py
Used to simulate the arm on matplotlib. Works as a ros node.
